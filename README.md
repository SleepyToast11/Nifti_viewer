## How It Works

- The shell spawns a **controller** when opening a file.  
- On success, the controller launches **3 MRI windows** and **1 time window**, each in its own thread.  
- Scrollbar inputs send update messages to the controller, which broadcasts them to all windows (including the sender).  
- Each window prepares the next image in a background thread, then swaps it into view once ready.  
- This process repeats until all windows are closed.
